## Questions and answers

### The TERMER-button is not shown on some pages
Some pages block certain javascript functionality. This can prevent the TERMER-button to appear. A small change of the site
configuration can allow TERMER to work.

### Why are concepts not underlined?
Only concepts in enabled dictionaries can be underlined. Concepts may still not be underlined if they:
- occur in links and headings
- are found in a large general dictionaries like Wikipedia
- are repeated in the same paragraph
You can still look up concepts by selecting them and pressing the enter key.
TERMER can only underline when there is an exact match between the text and the concept in the dictionary. You can try to search for a more basic form of a concept by selecting, a part of a it. For example a «member states» are not underlned whereas «member state» is.

### Why is the underlining of concepts slow?
TERMER will need to download data from IATE for the first use of each language for underlining. Subsequent use of the same language should be quicker.

There are two ways to open a PDF document with TERMER.
