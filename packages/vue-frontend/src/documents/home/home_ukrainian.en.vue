# Language service for communication with Ukrainian refugees

We would like to help make the start in Norway easier with the free use of Tingtun TERMER. The tool makes it possible to translate texts from Norwegian to Ukrainian and other languages. It is easy to use and is available at Tingtun Termer — Ukrainian, where you will also find an instructional video. Translations and word explanations are displayed on top of the original text with Tingtun Termer to improve the reading flow. Note that the service is designed to ensure privacy and users will not be tracked.

The service can translate from Norwegian to Ukrainian and from Ukrainian to Norwegian and can therefore be useful both for those who receive refugees and for the refugees themselves. We use machine translations from eTranslation provided by the European Commission and lookup from the Norwegian dictionaries "Ordbøkene" and "Store norske Leksikon".

We are constantly working on improving the service and would like to get feedback if you encounter errors or have suggestions. Please use the feedback button in the service.
